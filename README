FUNCITON
======================
The http_server.py and http_client.py are server and client side scripts to run to create a reverse shell, that communicate over http, hence the traffic can pass trough most firewalls.

HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPTS
======================
Make sure you have python 2 installed and then use the python command to run the scripts i.e. python http_server.py and python http_client.py.

ENHANCEMENTS
======================
Added a new file iehttp_client that uses Internet Explorer to send data to the server. This will bypass firewalls that allow only certain applications to initiate connections, as IE is whitelisted by default.
The script utilizes the pywin32 library.
